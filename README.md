# Chess-AI

*Content warning - this projects is a disasterous mess, viewer discretion advised

Solo project. This will be by no means at all a good program but I'm learning
This is a simple program hat will run in the terminal allowing the user to play chess against
the computer. I am currently in the process of making the chess bit, then I'll get on to the AI bit!

Massive thanks to Sebastian Lague and his program https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-AI which has been
an excellent reference/guide for this project.
